# ABOUT UTOPIA
PCOS/PCOD is a condition in which a woman's hormones are out of balance. It is a very common metabolic condition and around 1 in 4 women suffer from this condition. However, going through doctor appointments is a very tedious task and women may fall into the loophole of unnecessary medical tests. 

PCOS comes with irregular periods, cysts in ovaries, excess body hair, weight gain, acne, oily skin etc. It is very important for women to keep a strict check on their schedules and keep things in control. To help with this issue we have built an app "UTOPIA".
> UTOPIA with its elaborate questionnaire, predictor, schedule tracker and daily tips helps women get an idea about PCOS/PCOD and also encourage them to lead a healthy life.


# FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
Here are some of the potential future advancements that can help improve our Project further:
- Introduce a virtual platform for users to connect with doctors.
- Schedule lab tests for users.
- Autofill the data from lab reports with the app itself.
- Introduce a calendar along with a reminder system to help with PCOS/PCOD.
